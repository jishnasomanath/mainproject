#A Block Chain based Management System for Detecting Counterfeit Product in Supply Chain


In recent years, Counterfeit goods play a vital role in product manufacturing industries. This 
Phenomenon affects the sales and profit of the companies. To ensure the identification of real 
products throughout the supply chain, a functional block chain technology used for 
preventing product counterfeiting. By using a block chain technology, consumers do not need 
to rely on the trusted third parties to know the source of the purchased product safely. Any 
application that uses block chain technology as a basic framework ensures that the data 
content is ‘tamper resistant’. In view of the fact that a block chain is the decentralized, 
distributed and digital ledger that stores transactional records known as blocks of the public 
in several databases known as chain across many networks. Therefore, any involved block 
cannot be changed in advance, without changing all subsequent block. In this paper, 
counterfeit products are detected using barcode reader, where a barcode of the product linked 
to a Block Chain Based Management (BCBM) system. So the proposed system may be used 
to store product details and unique code of that product as blocks in database. It collects the 
unique code from the customer and compares the code against entries in block chain 
database. If the code matches, it will give notification to the customer, otherwise it gets 
information from the customer about where they bought the product to detect counterfeit 
product manufacturer.
